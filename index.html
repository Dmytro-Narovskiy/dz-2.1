        <h1 class="about-main-title">My favorite car brand</h1>
        <h2 class="about-car">My favorite car brand is Audi. Audi is a German car company. It started in 1909 in the city of Zwickau, in Germany.
            The founder of Audi was an engineer called August Horch. Today Audi is part of the Volkswagen Group and is
            known all over the world.</h2>
        <p class="about-car-desc">I love Audi because its cars are comfortable, safe and reliable. The design is modern and sporty, and the
            interiors feel premium. Audi also uses a lot of new technology, like quattro all-wheel drive and many
            electronic systems to help the driver.</p>
